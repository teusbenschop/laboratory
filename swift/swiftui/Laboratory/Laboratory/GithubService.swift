// SwiftUI is a declarative Component-Oriented framework
// What we have in SwiftUI is a state and view derived from the state.
// When the state changes, SwiftUI rebuilds the UI for that new state.

// The main difference between @State and @EnvironmentObject is

  // where only corresponding views can access and update them.
  // @State is a new Swift feature called a Property Wrapper.
  // The exciting aspect is the usage of the $ in $query.
  // It means that it gets a reference to the property wrapper, not to the value itself.
  // We use it to connect the TextField and the query variable in a two-way binding.
