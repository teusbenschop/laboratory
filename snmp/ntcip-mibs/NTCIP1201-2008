-- 2.2.1 Global Set ID Parameter
globalSetIDParameter OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX	INTEGER (0..65535)
ACCESS	read-only
STATUS	mandatory
DESCRIPTION 
"<Definition>  Specifies a relatively unique ID (e.g., this could be a counter, a check-sum, etc.) for all user-changeable parameters of the particular device-type currently implemented in the device.  Often this ID is calculated using a CRC algorithm. 
This value shall be calculated when a change of any static database object has occurred.  The value reported by this object shall not change unless there has been a change in the static data since the last request.  If the actual objects, which are to be included to create this object value, are not defined in the actual device-level standard such as 1202 or 1203, then the general guidance is to include all configuration objects that are stored in a type of memory that survives power outages.
A management station can use this object to detect any change in the static database objects by monitoring this value after it has established a baseline.

-- <Object Identifier> 1.3.6.1.4.1.1206.4.2.6.2

-- This node is an identifier used to group those objects used to manage a 
-- transaction.  
-- A transaction is a SET of one or more database parameters that have inter-
-- relationships with other database parameters, as such a SET for any one of 
-- these objects must be validated against a set of consistency checks and may 
-- potentially require the setting of a large number of objects 
-- simultaneously.  Thus, the mode described by these objects allow for such a 
-- large database download.  
-- Any device standard that allows this feature shall define which objects are 
-- database parameters versus status or control objects.

-- 2.3.1 Database Creation Transaction
dbCreateTransaction   OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX	INTEGER {	normal (1),
				transaction (2),
				verify (3),
				done (6)
       }
ACCESS	read-write
STATUS	mandatory

DESCRIPTION 
"<Definition>This object provides transaction control for device configuration.  The transaction mode changes the behavior of the agent to force buffering of database objects until all related database objects have been modified.  In the normal mode, SET operations to any database object shall either be stored in a device's database immediately with no regard to whether other changes will be made or be rejected (as defined in the device-specific Information Profile).  In the transaction mode, SET operations to any database object shall be buffered until a verify state performs a consistency check.  When the consistency check completes, the device automatically transitions to the done state where a normal or transaction command may be issued.  
A database object is a user provided piece of setup information (or it may be defined in an information profile) that is necessary for the proper operation of a device.  It is static in nature in that the agent would never change it without direction from the management station.  For example, a parameter that defines a default mode of operation would be a database object.  A parameter that indicates the current state of the device would not be a database object.
The states and commands are defined as:
NORMAL:  SET operations behave as normal SETs and shall have an immediate effect on the value of any database objects used by the device if none of the objects contained in the operation require the use of the transaction mode (as defined in the device-specific Information Profile).  A SET operation containing any database object that requires the use of transaction mode shall result in a genErr.  This is the default state of this object.  
The only command that may be written to dbCreateTransaction while in this state is TRANSACTION.  Any other values written to this object in this state shall result in an error response of 'badValue'.
TRANSACTION: A SET operation of one or more database objects that use the same community name as used in the request for the TRANSACTION state are buffered by the agent device for later consistency checks and a normal response is returned.  A SET operation of one or more database objects using different community names shall result in a genErr with the index set to zero.  A SET operation without a community name field (e.g., an STMP operation) shall be buffered by the agent device for later consistency checks and a normal response is returned.  Standard SYNTAX checking shall take place at the time of the SET operation.  A transaction may consist of multiple SET operations over multiple frames.  
A SET operation for one or more non-database objects shall be processed as normal even if it uses another community name, except for this (i.e., the dbCreateTransaction) object.  

A SET operation containing both database and non-database objects shall be processed in full according to these two rules.  Thus, if it contains the same community name as used in the request for the TRANSACTION state, the non-database objects shall be stored immediately while the database objects shall be buffered.  If it uses a different community name, the entire request will be rejected and a genErr with an index of zero shall be returned.
GET operations on any object shall return the values of the data stored in the controller and shall ignore any values contained in the buffer.  
Any valid community name may read this (dbCreateTransaction) object when in this state, but only the community name used to command the object to the transaction mode and the administrator community name can set this object. A set from any other community name shall result in a genErr with an index of zero. The only commands that can be written to dbCreateTransaction while in this state are VERIFY and NORMAL.  A VERIFY command will change the state to VERIFY.  If a NORMAL command is received, all buffered data is discarded and the state is returned to NORMAL.  Any other values written to this object when in this state shall result in an error response of 'badValue'.
VERIFY: Specific database objects are checked for consistency.  When consistency checks are complete the device will automatically advance to the DONE state.
The state of dbCreateTransaction cannot be changed when in the VERIFY state.  Any values written to this object in this state shall result in an error response of 'badValue'.
The consistency check analyzes certain critical objects 'in context' and treats them as an interrelated whole rather than separate non-related data items.   The consistency check rules are not defined in this standard.  They are device and implementation specific.  Where applicable, the consistency check rules are defined in application specific object definition standards.   A specific implementation may add additional checks beyond those defined in the standards. 

A SET operation containing any database objects while in the VERIFY state shall result in a genErr with the index set to zero.  
DONE:  This state is entered automatically once consistency checks have completed in the VERIFY mode.  The value of dbVerifyStatus and dbVerifyError indicate whether the consistency check found any errors.  

A SET operation containing any database objects while in the DONE state shall result in a genErr with the index set to zero.  
Any valid community name may read this (dbCreateTransaction) object when in this state, but only the community name used to command the object to the transaction mode and the administrator community name can set this object. A set from any other community name shall result in a genErr with an index of zero. The only commands that can be written to dbCreateTransaction while in this state are NORMAL and TRANSACTION.  Any other values written to this object in this state shall result in an error response of 'badValue'.
If a NORMAL command is issued and dbVerifyStatus indicates doneWithNoError, the buffered data is transferred to the device memory and the state is returned to NORMAL.  If a NORMAL command is issued and dbVerifyStatus indicates something other than doneWithNoError then the buffered data is discarded and the state is returned to NORMAL.
If a TRANSACTION command is issued, regardless of dbVerifyStatus, no action takes place (the buffered data is not changed) and the TRANSACTION state is re-entered.

Operational procedures and error responses:
(1)  Once a copy of all database objects is placed in a buffer the state is changed to transaction and error response indicates noError.  If the operation fails, the state remains the same and error response indicates genErr.
(2)  No action takes place, the state remains the same, but response indicates badValue.
(3)  The state is changed to verify, a consistency check is started, and response indicates noError.  Once the consistency check is completed, the state automatically changes to done.
(4)  The buffered copy of all database objects is discarded, the state is changed to normal, and response indicates noError. 
(5)  The buffered copy of all database objects is not changed or reloaded, the state is changed to transaction, and response indicates noError.
(6)  If dbVerifyStatus indicates doneWithNoError, then the copy of all database objects is transferred to memory, the state is changed to normal and response indicates noError.  If dbVerifyStatus indicates doneWithError then the buffered data is discarded, the state is changed to NORMAL, and response indicates noError.
(7)  The state will automatically change to done when the consistency check completes.
(8)  dbVerifyStatus and dbVerifyError are only valid in this state. 

(9)  All SET operations on this (dbCreateTransaction) parameter shall be made using a protocol that uses a community name, or equivalent field (e.g., SNMP).

DESCRIPTION
"This object is used to create unique transaction ID's for management stations to use when starting transactions using the dbCreateTransaction object.  This object will be incremented by one every time it is read, so that different values will be returned for each read.  Management stations wishing to start a transaction should first read the dbCreateTransaction object to verify that it is in the Normal state.  If so then the management shall GET dbMakeID to obtain a transaction ID to use, then SET dbCreateTransaction to startCmd and dbTransactionID to the value just received.  If the response to the SET operation is 'noError' then the management station has started a transaction.  If the response to the SET operation is 'genError' then the management station should read the dbCreateTransaction and dbTransactionID objects to ensure that the error was not due to a communications retry.  If the dbCreateTransaction is in the Transaction state, and the dbTransactionID is the same value returned by the read of this object, then the management station is the owner of the transaction.  If the dbTransactionID does not match the value originally returned by this object, then the management station is not the owner of the transaction and must wait until the dbCreateTransaction object returns to the Normal state before attempting to start the transaction.

     dstEndSecondsToTransition object defines an absolute time to end DST
     relative to midnight January 1, 1970.
     
     An entry of 'other' shall mean that DST adjustments are by a means other
     than this object. If this object is SET to 'other', the agent shall 
     return a genErr.
     If the value of this object is disabled(14) or other(15) , then the 
     values in the remaining objects in the current row of the 
     dstTable are irrelevant and therefore ignored by the device.

     An entry of 'disabled' shall mean that DST is controlled by this object 
     and is disabled. 
     Devices which support both this object and the older globalDaylightSaving 
     object shall follow the following rules.
        a. If globalDaylightSaving is SET to 'other', the device shall return 
           a genErr
        b. If globalDaylightSaving is SET to any other value, the device shall 
           automatically transition the value of dstBeginMonth to

     Devices which support this object and another mechanism to control
     daylight savings that is not defined by this standard shall follow the 
     following rules:
        a. If dstBeginMonth is SET to 'other', the device shall 
           return a genErr 
        b. If globalDaylightSaving or dstBeginMonth is SET to any
